## Course Description   
This course offers a rigorous introduction to data visualization from theory to implementation. Drawing on a combination of lectures, readings, discussions and coding, we will translate the timeless concepts of Minard, Playfair, Tufte and Wilkinson to new and diverse fields of study. Students will receive a coding crash-course in R, JavaScript, CSS, HTML and D3. The goal is not to become computer scientists, but to build the requisite foundation for modern implementation of exploratory and explanatory data visualizations. Students will have the opportunity to work in small teams to create interactive data visualizations worthy of their portfolios. The final deliverable will be a research-driven data visualization with accompanying prose in the form of a conference paper submission. A working knowledge of R from at least one previous class is highly recommended.  

## Deliverables
- **Quizzes (30%)** 
Quizzes are essential for assessing student learning and pedagogical efficacy. There will be 4 quizzes in total; students may pick their best three to count towards their final grade.
- **Homework (30%)**
Students will complete at least three assignments and submit them to the course repository as pull requests. All submissions must follow a "*Year-Month-Day-YourName-AssignmentName.FileExtension*" naming convention. Assignments will serve as progress indicators on key concepts, methods and techniques.
- **Semester Project (30%)**
Students will have the opportunity to work in small teams to create data visualizations worthy of their portfolios. The final deliverable will be a well-articulated, research-driven data visualization and accompanying prose in the form of a conference paper submission. Students will have considerable leeway in choosing a project topic and finding an appropriate conference or forum for submission.
- **Class Participation (10%)**
	- Attendance
	- Being awake, attentive and respectful
	- Being helpful to peers and the class as a whole
	- Contributing to group work and peer code reviews

* Install [git](http://git-scm.com/download)
* Create a [github](https://github.com/) account if you don't already have one
* Fork the class repo. Your assignments will be submitted as pull requests! 

    	git clone https://github.com/YOUR-NAME/data-viz.git
    	cd data-viz
    	git remote add upstream https://github.com/ecohen4/data-viz.git

## Submit Assignments 
Your assignments will be submitted as pull requests to the class repository on github! Suppose you saved changes on your own `gh-pages` branch and would like to submit a ‘clean’ pull request with only your files and the commits you want. This is pretty easy.

### Option 1: Basic way with file checkouts (losing history):
	git checkout upstream/gh-pages #you will be on a ‘detached HEAD’  
	git checkout -b hw1 #checkout a new branch called 'hw1'  
	git checkout <branch> <folder/filename> #pluck a folder/file from another branch but stay on the current branch (in this case 'hw1').  
	git add <folder/filename>
	git commit -m "add only the right files on new clean branch"
	git push -u hw1 #push commits to a new branch called hw1.

Your new `hw1` branch now has a copy of the folder/file(s) your plucked from elsewhere. Your working tree is still on the 'hw1' branch and you can continue to work on the files and commit+push further changes as frequently as you like.

### Option 2: Advanced way with Rebase (history re-written)
 
Rebasing rewrites history of a branch, in a really clever way. Each commit becomes a new commit, on top of a new beginning point. This is probably the most common way of making a clean pull request.
	
	git checkout gh-pages
	git checkout -b hw1
	git fetch upstream
	git rebase -i origin/gh-pages
	
At this point you’re given a list, where you can pick, squash, or remove commits from your branch. Remember, a branch is just a collection of commits. If, for example, you only want to include the last few commits, simply delete all the others and allow rebase to continue. You should now have a branch that contains only the commits you want.
