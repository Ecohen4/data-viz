## Quiz 4: Document Object Model

1. What does `CSS` stand for?
Cascading Style Sheets — just stylesheet would be ok. I saw one involving the word 'selector'. I'd give that partial credit

2. What does `DOM` stand for?
Document Object Model, or something very very close to that. The one answer that was html+css+js is ok.

3. Describe the difference between a PNG graphic generated by R with knitr, and an SVG, created with gridsvg or d3?
many people got the distinction between bitmaps and vectors. Partial credit for knowing what they stand for (portable network graphics, scalable vector graphics). 

4. Write the R equivalent of this javascript: `var myArray = [1, 2, 7, 10]`
myArray <- c(1,2,7,10) or something very very close to that. A list would work.

5. Write a CSS selector for _all_ the content paragraphs:
Something involving ".content"  or "#main-content" is probably acceptable. We talked a lot about it in class. I would give some credit to anything that looked like an attempt at a selector; d3.select("content") is close, just needs a dot… <g class="Tumblr"></g> does not look like a selector; it looks like an element.

6. Evaluate: `[1, 2, 7, 10].filter(function(i) { return i > 5 })[1]`
10 is the only correct answer. Partial credit for 7 (indexing off-by-one error). No credit for <5.

7. Which one is javascript?
Left. Duh.

8. Given an input d equal to the object `{"x": 10}`, what will the javascript one return?
undefined. Partial credit for object {x:10}, and fn that evals to 10.

9. Fix a bug. Both sides have one.
Ugh. Can you use your discretion here? Most answers are terrible.

10. What would you name a CSS class that applied style: `background-color: "#00FF00";`
something green is correct. Partial credit for blue or red. rgb(0,255,0) is not terrible. 

11. What is "#2A2A2A"
really anything is correct. We talked about why it's not a valid selector.

12. Write the R equivalent of this json: [{"x":10, "y":3, "color": "yellow"}, {"x":2, "y": 7, "color":"green"}]
Most of the answers look not bad. A few show no evidence of trying.

13. If `A <- c(10, 20, 30)` were a javascript array, what is the equivalent of `twenty <- A[2
var twenty = A[1] is correct. Most things with 'var' partial credit.

14. What is "class" in: <g class="labels label-text"></g>
An attribute. None of the others are at all correct. you use .attr() to set it.
