Write a function in R to plot a time series of air quality measurements for NYC using the `airquality` dataset in the `maps` library. The function must accept at least two input arguments, and return an object that can be plotted (or is plotted directly with the function call). The function must be non-trivial. For example, it cannot simply be a wrapper for plot().

You have 30 minutes to develop and test the function, and create a pull request to the class page on a new branch called `quiz`. 

Good luck!
